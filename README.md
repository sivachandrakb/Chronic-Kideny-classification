## 🔍 Prediction Output  

### ✅ Sample Prediction Pipeline  
1. **Input**: Patient data including biomarkers, demographics, and medical history  
2. **Preprocessing**: Feature scaling & missing value imputation  
3. **Model Processing**: ML/DL-based CKD risk assessment  
4. **Output**: Predicted CKD stage with confidence score  

### 📌 Example Prediction:  
| **Patient ID** | **Creatinine (mg/dL)** | **eGFR (mL/min/1.73m²)** | **CKD Stage** | **Confidence Score** |
|---------------|------------------|--------------------|------------|------------------|
| 1001 | 1.8 | 45 | Stage 3 | 91.2% |
| 1002 | 3.5 | 25 | Stage 4 | 87.6% |
| 1003 | 6.2 | 12 | Stage 5 (ESRD) | 95.4% |
